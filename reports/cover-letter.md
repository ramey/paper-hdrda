Dear Professor Colubi:\
\
Please find enclosed a manuscript entitled "High-Dimensional Regularized
Discriminant Analysis," which my coauthors, Mr. Caleb Stein, Dr. Phil Young,
and Professor Dean Young, and I are submitting for exclusive consideration of
publication as a research article in the *Computational Statistics and Data
Analysis*, with which we have had no prior interaction regarding our
manuscript.

In this paper we propose a regularized classifier that is intended for
small-sample, high-dimensional data, that is computationally efficient, and
that is often superior to several recently proposed sparse and regularized
classifiers in terms of classification accuracy. We have provided an _R_
implementation in the _sparsediscrim_ package, which is available on
_CRAN_. Furthermore, the classification study for the article is reproducible
and is available at: \url{https://github.com/ramhiser/paper-hdrda}. For the
classification study, we used standard microarray benchmark data sets and have
been bundled them in the _datamicroarray_ R package located at
\url{https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray}. This paper should be of
interest to a broad readership including those interested in efficient sparse
and regularized classifiers for high-dimensional classification.

Due to a potential conflict of interest, we respectfully request that the
following six individuals not be asked to review the paper:

1. Professor Daniella Witten, University of Washington, USA
2. Professor Robert Tibshirani, Stanford University, USA
3. Yaqian Guo, Stanford University, USA
4. Professor Trevor Hastie, Stanford University, USA
5. Professor Herbert Pang, Duke University, USA
6. Professor Tiejun Tong, Hong Kong Baptist University, Hong Kong
7. Professor Hongyu Zhao, Yale University, USA

Thank you for your consideration of our work. Please address all correspondence
