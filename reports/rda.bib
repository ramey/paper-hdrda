The article discusses a ridge-regression covariance estimator for outlier detection as well as Friedman's (1989) Regularized Discriminant Analysis (RDA) model for binary classification.

They use a jackknife approach (which they incorrectly call it a "leave-one-out bootstrap" approach) to determine the distribution of the sample Mahalanobis distance with a shrunken covariance matrix. The shrinkage parameter, lambda, is chosen to minimize the 50th and 95th percentiles of this distribution. Then, outliers are determined as observations in the critical region using the 95th percentile using the 'optimal' value of lambda.

The RDA model is used with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach to select the optimal RDA model pair. They present a heatmap of error rates on page 2398. Then, the authors discuss ties in the error rates. To select the optimal model among the best tied rates, they use a plug-in Kullback-Leibler divergence. There are many issues with this approach, some of which I have discussed in a note in the paper.}

* Shows that a solution to the classical LDA optimization problem in Equation 9 is given by the solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem: S_b x = \lambda S_t x
* Because this involves the inverse of S_t, which is singular for p {\&}gt; N, S_t needs to be regularized
* In Section 3, shows that the solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem has a low-rank representation. 
* Derives explicitly the eigendecomposition of the solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem with regularization
* Shows that ULDA is the limiting case of RLDA
* Shows that ULDA maps all points from the same class to a common point; perfect class separation but leads to overfitting. RLDA fixes this.
* Uses a grid of size m = 1000. It is not clear what the maximum tuning parameter value is.}
