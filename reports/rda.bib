annote = {Here's an outline of the paper:

* Replace pooled sample covariance matrix in Friedman's RDA with the total scatter matrix
* Shows Null(S_t) is a subset of Null(S_b) and Null(S_t) is a subset of Null(\Sigma_k)
* Decompose the RDA matrix
* Rewrite the RDA classification rule in terms of the decomposed RDA matrix
* Shows that the second sum in the RDA decision rule is constant for all classes
* Derives efficient expressions for the remaining inverses and determinants
* Notes that a new test point is independent of the inverses and determinants
* Uses a tuning-parameter grid of 900 parameters b/c the search is fast!}

* Shows that a solution to the classical LDA optimization problem in Equation 9 is given by the solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem: S_b x = \lambda S_t x
* Because this involves the inverse of S_t, which is singular for p {\&}gt; N, S_t needs to be regularized
* In Section 3, shows that the solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem has a low-rank representation. 
* Derives explicitly the eigendecomposition of the solution to the generalized eigenvalue problem with regularization
* Shows that ULDA is the limiting case of RLDA
* Shows that ULDA maps all points from the same class to a common point; perfect class separation but leads to overfitting. RLDA fixes this.
* Uses a grid of size m = 1000. It is not clear what the maximum tuning parameter value is.}
